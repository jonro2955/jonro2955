## üëã&nbsp; Hi, I'm Jonathan

Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! I'm a full stack web developer based in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I began building my web development skills after becoming facinated with creating beautiful WordPress websites. Having lacked a clear career goal in the past, it was difficult for me to stick with something long enough to make a significant progress in a career. I've decided to dedicate myself to achieving success as a web developer, since I find the work quite fulfilling.

This is a PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node) application that allows job seekers to save the details of each job application they make in a custom web application, in order to manage their job search better. For each job application, it will store things like the job description, resume and cover letter PDF files used, URLs, notes, and dates in a convenient and easy to use manner to enable searching, reading, and updating of the variable job application data. Please note that this preview is not how the finished version will look, as both the front and back ends are still under active development.

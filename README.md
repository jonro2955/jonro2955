## üëã&nbsp; Hi, I'm Jonathan

Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! I'm a full stack web developer based in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I began building my web development skills after becoming facinated with creating beautiful WordPress websites. Having lacked a clear career goal in the past, it was difficult for me to stick with something long enough to make a significant progress in a career. I've decided to dedicate myself to achieving success as a web developer, since I find the work quite fulfilling.

This is a PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node) application that allows job seekers to save the details of each job application they make in a custom web application to manage their job search better. It will store things like the job descriptions, resume and cover letter PDF files used for each application, URLs, notes, and dates in an convenient and easy to use manner to enable searching, reading, and updating job application data. (Please note that this preview is not how the finished version will look, as it is still under active development).
